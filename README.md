# About the Project: Snake Game
In this Python code, I've crafted a Snake game using Turtle graphics. As the player, I control a snake with arrow keys, guiding it to consume randomly appearing blue food items. Eating food increases the snake's length and my score. The game incorporates collision detection, ending if the snake hits screen boundaries or itself. The code is modular, with separate classes for Snake, Food, and Scoreboard, ensuring readability. The Snake class manages movement and growth, while the Food class handles appearance and relocation. The Scoreboard class tracks my score, updating it on the screen and displaying a "GAME OVER" message upon completion. This code serves as a foundation for a playable Snake game with potential for further customization.
